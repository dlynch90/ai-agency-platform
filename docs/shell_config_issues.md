Home dotfiles audit: ~/.zshrc hardcodes massive PATH with /Users/daniellynch and many mise install bins; also runs `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` while ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc comments out mise activation (conflict). ~/.zprofile (shim) resets PATH, includes duplicate cleanup lines, and hardcodes DEV_HOME=/Users/daniellynch/Developer; also adds PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with hardcoded user path. ~/.profile contains a stray `fi` line (syntax error) and hardcoded LM Studio PATH; ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile include multiple hardcoded user paths and auto-load secrets scripts; ~/.pnpmrc hardcodes store-dir=/Users/daniellynch/.pnpm-store. ~/.config/zsh/.zprofile is clean XDG-first PATH and recommended place for `mise activate --shims`. ~/.config/zsh/.zshenv is minimal but still sources ~/.local/share/cargo/env. .config/zsh/.zshrc contains a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:7242/ingest/...')` call (suspicious in shell init). Key SSOT gap: repo .tool-versions vs .mise.toml conflict, and mixed managers (rvm, pyenv, rbenv, sdkman, nvm) present despite desire to standardize on mise+uv+pixi.
