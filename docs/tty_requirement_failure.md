Attempted to run `mprocs` headless via `nohup script -q <log> mprocs ... &` for MCP servers; process exited immediately and log contained only terminal control sequences. `mprocs` runs fine with a simple `sleep 60` under `script`, but with MCP commands it still exits (likely due to TTY/headless behavior). Use an interactive terminal to run `mprocs` if you need persistent MCP sessions.
