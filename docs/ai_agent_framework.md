Successfully implemented comprehensive LangChain + LangGraph + Pydantic AI agent swarm orchestration system. Created modular framework with multiple specialized agents (research, code analysis, evaluation, optimization), LangGraph workflows, Ollama integration, DeepEval metrics, Redis caching, and Neo4j knowledge storage. Framework handles missing API keys gracefully and prioritizes local Ollama models. Ready for transformer pipeline evaluation and multi-agent consensus workflows.
