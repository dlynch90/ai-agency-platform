# No Custom Code Rule

## Core Principle
**ZERO CUSTOM CODE**: All implementations must use vendor solutions, community libraries, or official SDKs

## Prohibited Patterns
- ❌ Custom React components
- ❌ Custom hooks
- ❌ Custom utilities
- ❌ Custom configurations
- ❌ Custom styling frameworks
- ❌ Complex build setups
- ❌ Custom business logic implementations
- ❌ Custom UI components and designs
- ❌ Custom database schemas and migrations
- ❌ Custom API endpoints and services
- ❌ Custom documentation and analysis

## Required Vendor Solutions
- ✅ Use only vendor-sourced libraries and tools
- ✅ Import from approved vendor repositories
- ✅ Use vendor CLI tools and SDKs
- ✅ Implement vendor architectural patterns
- ✅ Follow vendor documentation and best practices

## Enforcement
- Pre-commit hooks enforce these rules
- CI/CD pipelines validate compliance
- Code reviews check for violations
- Automated tools prevent custom code commits
