# Cursor IDE Organization Rules

## Directory Structure Requirements

- **All documentation** must be in `/docs/` directory
- **All scripts** must be in `/scripts/` directory
- **All configurations** must be in `/configs/` directory
- **All tests** must be in `/testing/` directory

## File Organization Standards
- **Markdown files** (.md) → `/docs/` directory only
- **Shell scripts** (.sh) → `/scripts/` directory only
- **Configuration files** (.toml, .json, .yaml) → `/configs/` directory only
- **Python files** (.py) → appropriate feature directories

## Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pre-commit hooks** must be in `.cursor/hooks/pre-commit/`
- **Post-commit hooks** must be in `.cursor/hooks/post-commit/`
- **CI/CD automation** must be in `.cursor/automation/`

## MCP Integration
- **MCP server configs** must be in `.cursor/mcp/`
- **Server definitions** must follow Cursor MCP protocol
- **Environment variables** must be properly scoped

## Enforcement
- **Zero tolerance** for loose files in root directory
- **Automatic cleanup** of unorganized files
- **Pre-commit validation** of file organization
- **CI/CD blocking** for organization violations
