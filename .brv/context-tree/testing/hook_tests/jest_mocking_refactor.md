Worklog: Fixed failing Jest suites in apps/web. Added stable WebSocket handling in `src/hooks/use-websocket.ts` by using a `socketRef`, preventing effect dependency loops and reconnect storms; cleanup now closes via ref without re-triggering effects. In `apps/web/jest.setup.js` added global mocks: `WebSocket` stub + `fetch` stub to avoid network and logging failures in tests. Refactored `src/__tests__/hooks/useSupabase.test.tsx` to use renderHook/act with `QueryClientProvider`, corrected mock chain for update/delete to include `.match`, and switched mock path to `@/components/providers`. Targeted tests now pass (`useSupabase`, `useWebSocket`).
