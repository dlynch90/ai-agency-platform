Gap-analysis toolchain audit for /Users/daniellynch/Developer: missing CLI tools for bulk refactors are `comby`, `typos`, `codespell`, and JS/TS formatters `eslint`/`prettier` (not on PATH). Present: rg, sg, jq, yq, taplo, sd, gsed, gawk, fzf, fd, ruff, biome, commitlint, gitleaks, trivy, syft, grype, dive, shellcheck, shfmt, actionlint, task, just, make. Use Lefthook-only hooks policy (no pre-commit). Recommended remediation plan includes AST scans (ast-grep), regex sweeps (rg + sd/comby), naming conventions enforcement (ruff/pylint + eslint naming rules), spellcheck (typos/codespell), and overconstraint analysis of hooks/tasks/CI runtimes.
