Replaced mise usage with portable shell SSOT. Added /Users/daniellynch/.config/shell/env.sh (XDG + DEV paths + tool defaults + language XDG vars) and /Users/daniellynch/.config/shell/paths.sh (PATH builder with Volta, PNPM_HOME, cargo/go bins, brew shellenv, optional lmstudio/bun, dedupe). Simplified ~/.zshrc and ~/.zprofile to XDG shims. Rewrote /Users/daniellynch/.config/zsh/.zprofile to source env.sh + paths.sh and removed mise activation. Rewrote /Users/daniellynch/.config/zsh/.zshrc to remove network telemetry fetch, add direnv hook, and keep basic history/completion/aliases. Simplified /Users/daniellynch/.config/zsh/.zshenv to minimal XDG + ZDOTDIR and source env.sh; uses $CARGO_HOME/env if present. Simplified ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile to source env.sh + paths.sh and removed hardcoded paths and broken 'fi'. Updated pnpm store path to XDG in /Users/daniellynch/.config/pnpm/rc. Removed repo /Users/daniellynch/Developer/.mise.toml. Updated /Users/daniellynch/Developer/.envrc to warn on missing docker compose (prefers docker compose plugin).
