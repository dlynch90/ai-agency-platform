Work summary: aligned apps/api/frontend zod to ^4.2.1 to match workspace and avoid zodResolver type mismatch with zod/v4; Next 16 expects `reactCompiler` at top-level (not under `experimental`) in `apps/web/next.config.mjs`. Build failure root cause: `tsconfig.base.json` deleted in working tree; packages extending it (e.g. `packages/@shared/utils/tsconfig.json`) cause `tsc` TS5083. `turbo.json` also deleted; `turbo run clean` fails without it (HEAD has a standard pipeline config). Use `git show HEAD:tsconfig.base.json` and `git show HEAD:turbo.json` to restore if desired.
