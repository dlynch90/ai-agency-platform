Completed rebuild/validation workflow in /Users/daniellynch/Developer. Fixed cache cleanup tasks in `.mise.toml` by adding `fd -u` to include ignored cache dirs for `cache:clean:workspace` (so .pytest_cache/.ruff_cache/.mypy_cache/.turbo are actually removed). Updated `Taskfile.yml` to call `mise run cache:clean` + `mise run cache:clean:workspace` and `mise run repo.check` (since `pnpm clean:all` / `pnpm validate:all` scripts do not exist). Updated root `package.json` workspaces from `app/*` to `apps/*` and added nested patterns to align with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Added missing deps to `apps/web/package.json`: `kafkajs`, `@temporalio/client`, `@temporalio/worker`. Added placeholder Temporal workflow files: `apps/web/src/workflows/activities.ts` and `apps/web/src/workflows/index.ts` (empty exports) to fix Next build error from `apps/web/src/lib/temporal-worker.ts` importing `../workflows/activities`.
Rebuild steps run (manual due to uv lock): `uv cache prune --force`, `pnpm store prune`, `mise prune --yes`, `mise cache clear`, `brew cleanup --prune=0 && brew autoremove`, `docker system prune -f` + `docker builder prune -f`, `mise run cache:clean:workspace`, remove `node_modules` and build artifacts via `fd -u ... -x rm -rf`, `pnpm install`, `uv sync --all-extras`, `pnpm run build`, `mise run repo.check`. Initial build failed due to missing workflows; after stubs build succeeded. Validation passed (ruff, turbo lint/typecheck/test, pytest) with skips for archived tests and a Keras FutureWarning. `next lint` prompted for ESLint config in apps/web during `repo.check` (interactive), accepted default; no config file was created, so add a local ESLint config in apps/web if you want to avoid prompts. `pnpm install` warned about ignored build scripts (e.g., @temporalio/core-bridge, @sentry/cli); run `pnpm approve-builds` if those scripts are required.
