Worklog: Fixed Next.js app build pipeline in apps/web. Created client-only AppProviders component to own QueryClient and provider tree, and updated app/layout.tsx to render <AppProviders>. Added env normalization guards in components/providers.tsx and client-clerk-provider.tsx to treat 'undefined'/'null' strings as missing and avoid hard crashes; Liveblocks/Supabase/Clerk now no-op with warnings when keys missing. Removed NEXT_PUBLIC env injection block and turbopack config from apps/web/next.config.mjs; build now runs via webpack. Updated apps/web/package.json build script to `NODE_ENV=production next build --webpack` because .env.local sets NODE_ENV=development, which caused prerender failures (useContext/useState null) unless overridden. Added devDependency @babel/preset-env to satisfy jest babel-jest config. Build succeeds with NODE_ENV=production; webpack warns about require-in-the-middle (OpenTelemetry/Sentry). Jest now runs but fails in useSupabase tests (render not imported; invalid hook call from calling useUpdateRecord/useDeleteRecord outside hook context; isSuccess never true) and useWebSocket tests (maximum update depth due to disconnect->setSocket in cleanup).
