Audit notes for /Users/daniellynch/Developer: apps/web has vendor-connector gaps and custom wrappers. apps/web/src/hooks/use-socket.ts defines SocketContext but SocketProvider returns children without a SocketContext.Provider; apps/web/src/components/providers.tsx never wraps with SocketProvider, so useSocket() throws and websocket integration is broken. apps/web/src/components/providers.tsx contains stubbed neo4jDriver and qdrantClient placeholders; hooks use-neo4j.ts and use-qdrant.ts call these stubs, yielding fake connection status and violating vendor-only/no custom wrapper policy. apps/web/src/hooks/use-generative-ai.ts calls /api/ai/generate but no route exists (only reference), so AI integration is non-functional. shared/packages/websocket-server is marked custom implementation; middleware/auth.ts uses custom JWT/API key auth and custom rate limiting (local Map + Redis incr) rather than vendor express-rate-limit/Clerk; also uses crypto.timingSafeEqual and randomBytes. services/mcp-gateway/main.py is custom Python with placeholder MCP calls. Many client-side hooks/providers log via fetch to http://127.0.0.1:7246/ingest (custom telemetry) in use-socket.ts, providers.tsx, use-neo4j.ts, use-qdrant.ts, use-supabase.ts, use-generative-ai.ts, debug-panel.tsx.
